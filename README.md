# Soobmit
This application's purpose is to easily submit files from your friends to you.

### Usage
Run the server locally on your machine:
1. Download the backend folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the packages.
3. Run `node server.js` in the backend folder to start the server.

Forward your ip. Easiest solution is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows?tab=download).
1. Add ngrok to path.
2. Open a terminal (WIN + R and type `cmd`)
3. Run `ngrok http 3000`
4. Copy the url that is forwarded (should look like `https://numbers.ngrok-free.app`)

Ask friends to navigate to [Soobmit](https://gargant0373.github.io/Soobmit/) and connect to your server.
